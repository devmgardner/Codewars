start with string n
make list from n, reverse list
for each character in nlist:
	convert character to binary using ASCII table:
		take index of character in hexalph list, add 33
		convert that integer to binary, turn binary into a string
		turn string into list, remove 'b' (list[0]), convert back to string
		append to templist1
combine templist1 into a string, padding ending 0's to make multiple of 6, then turn back to templist1
take first 6 characters as variable w, then update templist1 to remove first 6 characters
convert variable w to integer, convert integer to string
append to templist2
for each word in templist2:
	convert to int, then -33
	take hexalph[result], append to finlist
convert finlist into string, return string
